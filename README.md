Symptom Screening Chatbot

A lightweight AI-powered chatbot built using Python to assist users in identifying possible health conditions based on reported symptoms. This project aims to demonstrate how natural language processing and rule-based logic can be combined to support health screening conversations.

Project Overview

This chatbot simulates a simple medical assistant that interacts with users and responds to health-related queries. It is not intended for diagnosis but rather as an educational and functional example of building conversational AI in healthcare contexts.

Developed as part of my learning journey in data and cloud technologies, this project showcases:

Basic conversational flow logic

Rule-based decision making

Symptom keyword detection

User-friendly interface using Google Colab

Features

Detects and responds to common symptom keywords

Provides general advice or prompts for further consultation

Simple, human-readable logic suitable for beginners

Easily customizable for other domains or use cases

Technologies Used

Python 3

Google Colab (Jupyter notebook environment)

No external libraries required â€“ runs with base Python

Project Structure

Symptom_Screening_Chatbot.ipynb â€“ Main notebook file

README â€“ Project documentation

How to Run

Open the notebook in Google Colab

Run each cell in sequence

Enter symptom descriptions when prompted to interact with the chatbot

Sample Interaction
ðŸ¤– Hello! I'm your health assistant. What symptoms are you experiencing today?
ðŸ‘¤ I have a sore throat and slight fever.
ðŸ¤– You may have symptoms of a mild infection like the flu. Please monitor and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen.

Disclaimer
This chatbot is not a substitute for professional medical advice. It is for demonstration and learning purposes only.
